# Mass

Metadata Artifact Search Service - A service for searching metadata artifacts and filtering results.

## Description

The Metadata Artifact Search Service uses search parameters to look for metadata.

### Quick Overview of API
The API provides two not strictly RESTful endpoints:

One endpoint ("GET /search-options") will return an overview of all metadata classes
that can be targeted by a search.

The actual search endpoint ("GET /search") can be used to search for these target classes
using keywords. Hits will be reported in the context of the selected target class.
This means that target classes will be reported that match the specified search query,
however, the target class might contain embedded other classes and the match might
occur in these embedded classes, too.

Along with the hits, facet options are reported that can be used to filter down the hits by
performing the same search query again but with specific facet selections being set.

The search endpoint supports pagination to deal with a large number of search results.
Facet options can help avoid having to rely on this feature by filtering down the number
of hits to a single page.

For more information see the OpenAPI spec linked below.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-built version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/mass):
```bash
docker pull ghga/mass:6.0.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/mass:6.0.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/mass:6.0.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
mass --help
```

### Usage:

A template YAML for configuring the service can be found at
[`./example_config.yaml`](./example_config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.mass.yaml`, and place it in one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory where you execute the service (on Linux: `./.mass.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on Linux: `~/.mass.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example_config.yaml`](./example_config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `mass_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `mass_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To use file secrets, please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## HTTP API
An OpenAPI specification for this service can be found [here](./openapi.yaml).

## Architecture and Design:
This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.

This service is currently designed to work with MongoDB and uses an aggregation pipeline to produce search results.

Typical sequence of events is as follows:

1. Requests are received by the API, then directed to the QueryHandler in the core.

2. From there, the configuration is consulted to retrieve any facetable and selected fields for the searched resource class.

3. The search parameters and facet fields are passed to the Aggregator, which builds and runs the aggregation pipeline on the appropriate collection. The aggregation pipeline is a series of stages run in sequence:
   1. Run a text match using the query string.
   2. Apply a sort based on the IDs.
   3. Apply any filters supplied in the search parameters.
   4. Extract the facets.
   5. Keep only selected fields if some have been specified.
   6. Transform the results structure into {facets, hits, hit count}.

4. Once retrieved in the Aggregator, the results are passed back to the QueryHandler where they are shoved into a QueryResults Pydantic model for validation before finally being sent back to the API.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a command `dev_install` is available for convenience.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, and it installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`lock/requirements-dev.txt`](./lock/requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
